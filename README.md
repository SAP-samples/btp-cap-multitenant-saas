## Description

The **Sustainable SaaS (SusaaS)** sample application has been built in a partner collaboration to help interested developers, partners, and customers in developing multitenant Software as a Service applications using CAP and deploying them to the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). For this use-case, the **SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry** and **Kyma Runtime** were chosen. Still, you can also develop similar SaaS applications in the **SAP BTP, ABAP environment** ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/multitenancy-and-saas-applications) for further details).

The example focuses on using standard frameworks and SAP BTP services for developing, deploying, and monitoring the solution like the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), SAP API Management, Alert Notification, and many more. 

The sample application has a focus on the topic of sustainability and is therefore called **Sustainable SaaS** (Susaas) app. It allows customers (**Consumer Tenants**) of the SaaS application to extend their SAP solutions like SAP S/4HANA with additional features developed by the SaaS vendor (**Provider**). 

Due to the technical and theoretical complexity of the topic, the sample application shall not be seen or used in any kind for productive scenarios. It is supposed to present ideas and approaches for putting your scenario into practice. Our goal is to cover as many topics as we can, but not in the greatest depth that might justify productive usability.  

Below you can find the solution architecture diagrams of our sample application. As you can see, the Kyma as well as the Cloud Foundry architecture both contain a lot of services and tools which you will use in this tutorial (click to enlarge).

 Once you successfully deployed the Basic features of the SaaS sample application to your Cloud Foundry landscape or Kyma Cluster, feel free to enhance it with more features as part of the **Advanced Version**. This includes for example a SAP API Management integration to monitor and manage your SaaS API endpoints or SAP Identity Authentication to provide a Central User Management without relying on SAP ID service. Furthermore, you will learn and see a sample of how to integrate a backend system like SAP S/4HANA from a SaaS Consumer perspective.

If you need assistance assigning entitlements to your Provider Subaccount, you might find information [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/service-ticket-intelligence/service-ticket-intelligence-user-guide/assign-entitlement-to-subaccount?locale=en-US).


### Advanced Features

The **Advanced Features** require some additional services and software components which are listed below. Please note that the **SAP Identity Authentication Service** is only available in **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)** and **CPEA** accounts.

| Service                                                                                                         | Free (Tier) / (Trial) Plans                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| [SAP Integration Suite](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/integration-suite?region=all)         | Free (Application) <br> *(Trial: trial (Application))* |
| [Cloud Identity Services](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/identity-authentication?region=all) | default (Application)  <br> Application                |
| SAP S/4HANA 2021 (or newer)                                                                                     |                                                        |

Please check the below details on these additional entitlements required for the Advanced Version. Especially using the **Cloud Identity Services** it is essential to understand the licensing model to remain within the **free** usage boundaries! 

**SAP Integration Suite** 

> The **free service plan** is usable for 90 days only. Your tenant will be decommissioned after 90 days and you need to set up a new tenant if you wish to do further validations. 

**Cloud Identity Services**

> When signing up for a PAYG or CPEA account, you're entitled for **one free** test and productive **SAP Identity Authentication Service (SAP IAS)** tenant. Use the **Cloud Identity Services** plan **default (Application)** to create such an instance in your environment. Any further tenant can be licensed as **Additional Tenant** and will be charged according to your account type. Please also check the official SAP Help documentation ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/93160ebd2dcb40e98aadcbb9a970f2b9.html?locale=en-US#loio93160ebd2dcb40e98aadcbb9a970f2b9__licensing_section)) and the following blog post ([click here](https://community.sap.com/t5/application-development-blog-posts/is-sap-cloud-identity-services-for-free/ba-p/13512212)) for further information. Please check for potentially existing SAP IAS tenants first, to make sure you are sticking to the free service offering limits. 
> 
> Using the **SAP Identity Authentication Service**, please make sure to comply with the license model, which is highly dependent on the application registration type created in SAP IAS. Using SAP IAS for authentication scenarios involving third-party solutions will result in costs! While SAP Cloud to SAP Cloud Log-ons are usually part of your overall SAP BTP contract, make sure you understand the licensing model before extensively using SAP IAS as part of your overall architecture. Additional information can be found in SAP Help ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/tenant-model-and-licensing?locale=en-US)).
>
> The service plan **application** allows you to create respective Service Instances within SAP BTP, that will automatically register an application in the **trusted** SAP IAS tenant configured in your Subaccount configuration. 

**SAP S/4HANA** 

> An SAP S/4HANA system is actually not part of your SAP BTP Provider Subaccount, but is required if you want to test the automated data push feature from an existing SAP On-Premise solution. While we recommend to use at least the SAP S/4HANA 2021 release, with a bit of coding effort you should also be able to integrate older releases. This tutorial assumes you have at least access to an SAP S/4HANA 2021 release. Feel free to check out the SAP Cloud Appliance Library (https://cal.sap.com/) to get yourself a free test license. 


## Known Issues
**Open**
  - Automated Credential Rotation (Workaround available - 2023/06/09)
    - **Problem**: Users are facing a callback authentication error after successful login via SAP IAS as part of the One-Domain concept. 
    - **Issue**: Activating the automated credential rotation of the SAP BTP Service Operator renews the X.509 certificate of the respective SAP IAS service bindings. As the Application Router caches the binding details for performance reasons, the cached X.509 certificate is not valid anymore after rotation. This results in an authentication error between Application Router and SAP IAS. 
    - **Workaround**: A restart of the Application Router after credential rotation will solve this issue and the latest X.509 certificate is being cached. This restart can be automated in a Kubernetes/Kyma CronJob, starting a new Deployment rollout according to your credential rotation cycle. Combined with an external Redis cache for Application Router session management, downtimes can be minimized or completely mitigated! Make sure to have a sufficient overlap of both, the old and new X.509 certificate (*rotatedBindingTTL: 24h* & *rotationFrequency: 48h*), so the cached credentials are still valid until the restart has happened!
    - **Solution**: Issue has been addressed and a potential notification mechanism might trigger an automated update of the Application Router cache in the future (subject to change). 
  - Consumer extension API issue (Workaround available - 2022/12/19)
    - **Problem**: Applying a Consumer extension currently results in the Push API not being usable by the extended Tenant anymore. 
    - **Issue**: The current implementation has issues to read and process the CSN file of the extended SaaS CAP service. This service serves as a base for the API CAP service.
    - **Workaround**: Extensibility has been temporarily disabled for the CAP API Service.
    - **Solution**: Issues has been addressed with the CAP product management and potential solutions will be worked on.
