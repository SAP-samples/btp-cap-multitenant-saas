## 1. Basic Platform Concepts

> **Hint** - Check the official documentation to learn more ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/sap-business-technology-platform)).

SAP BTP offers customers and partners the ability to turn data into business value, compose end-to-end business processes, and build and extend SAP applications quickly. The services and solutions of SAP BTP are available on multiple Cloud Infrastructure Providers in data centers all around the globe. 

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Ali Cloud

The multi-cloud strategy supports different environments and runtimes for application development, such as **Kyma**, **Cloud Foundry**, **ABAP Cloud**, as well as multiple different regions, and a broad choice of programming languages. This tutorial will provide detailed end-to-end development guidance for the **Cloud Foundry** as well as the **Kyma** Runtime. 

The central point of entry to the platform is the SAP BTP Cockpit, where you can access your accounts and applications and manage all activities associated with them. You can find the region-specific URLs below. 

> **Hint** - You can use any of those links to access any of your SAP BTP accounts. The regional availability serves the performance of the Cockpit application, so we suggest to use the closest regional URL when working with the Cockpit.

**Enterprise vs. Trial Accounts**

> **Hint** - Check the official documentation to learn more ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/trial-accounts-and-free-tier)).

Just a few comments on the SAP BTP Account requirements for this use case. You can set up our sample application in any SAP BTP environment using **Free (Tier) service plans** ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/using-free-service-plans) to learn more) of your own **Pay-as-you-Go** (PAYG) or **CPEA** account ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/what-is-consumption-based-commercial-model?locale=en-US) to learn more). 

We highly suggest to create such an **Enterprise Account** for the purpose of validating this and any future use case. While you can set up our sample application also in **Trial** accounts, only an **Enterprise Account** allows you to move from **Free Tier** to **Paid** service plans if required. Additionally, Trial accounts encompass a few more limitations like a restricted 14 day test period for any new Kyma Cluster.

> **Hint** - A tutorial how to set up a **free PAYG account** (allowing you to use all Free Tier service plans) can be found in the [Tutorial Navigator](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-free-tier-account.html). 

**Runtimes**

The key pillars of developing business applications on SAP BTP are the runtimes which can be chosen based on the customer's requirement and expertise. In this scenario, the established **Cloud Foundry Runtime** as well as SAP's managed Kubernetes offering called **Kyma Runtime** will be covered in greater detail below. 

 If you are new to SAP BTP, or in case you already used the **Cloud Foundry Runtime** and now wonder whether you should also discover the **Kyma Runtime**, please read the runtime introductions below and check out the great runtime comparison in the following blog post [click here](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/developing-an-application-on-sap-btp-cloud-foundry-runtime-and-sap-btp-kyma/ba-p/13550062).

## 4. Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)

As our SaaS sample application is based on the so-called **Cloud Application Programming Model** also known as **CAP**, so please familiarize yourself with the basics of this brilliant framework! As we cannot summarize the essence of CAP any better than the official **Capire** documentation (https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/), let us briefly check how the experts describe it. 

*"The SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) is a framework of languages, libraries, and tools for building enterprise-grade services and applications. It guides developers along a ‘golden path’ of proven [best practices](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#enterprise-best-practices) and a great wealth of [out-of-the-box solutions](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#generic-providers) to recurring tasks.*

*CAP-based projects benefit from a [primary focus on domain](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#domain-modeling). Instead of delving into overly technical disciplines, we focus on [accelerated development](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#grow-as-you-go) and [safeguarding investments](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/#agnostic-approach) in a world of rapidly changing cloud technologies."*

Besides using CAP for the definition of our SaaS **tenant data model**, as well as the data model shared amongst all subscribers, we are using much more features as part of this SaaS sample application. Based on these **data models**, CAP provides the required **OData Services** including **Annotations** used by our Fiori Elements UIs out-of-the-box, CAP is backing our multitenant **SaaS Inbound API**, and handles security checks across our application. Last but not least, we are making use of the latest **@sap/mtxs** package ([click here](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/multitenancy/mtxs)), utilized to simplify multitenant related requirements like **tenant provisioning** ([click here](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/multitenancy/mtxs#saasprovisioningservice)), **extensibility** ([click here](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/multitenancy/mtxs#extensibilityservice)) or even **feature toggle** support ([click here](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/extensibility/feature-toggles)). 

If you're new to CAP, please acquaint yourself with the basics of CAP right now, before you start getting your head around our SaaS sample application deployment. Start by reading what CAP is all about (https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/about/), set foot on the Getting Started guide (https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/), and get the core features of CAP in a nutshell (https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/in-a-nutshell).
